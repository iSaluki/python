Here's what you need to do to use a Selenium script:

1) Make sure you have Python installed properly.

2) Get the Selenium driver for your preferred browser on your OS. I use Chrome, so I have used the Chrome driver in my scripts, but it is easy to change this to another driver.
You can find downloads for the drivers here: https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/

3) Extract the webdriver file from the archive and place it in the same folder as the Selenium script that you want to run.

4) Assuming that you've made any necessary code adjustments (Chrome users shouldn't need to do this), then you'll be able to run the script properly now.

If you have any problems with this, then open an issue and I'll try to help you.
