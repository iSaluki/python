# Python Repository
A collection of simple Python scripts

**Note:** If you have any problems with any scripts, please open an issue and I'll be happy to help you. I'm also happy to help out with extending/changing functionality in any of my scripts. Just let me know.
And I am also able to do requests.

# Reference:

*guessgame.py* **->** Guessing game which prompts the user to guess a word from a list of preset words in the script.

*numbergame.py* **->** Prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 after randomly generating one. It then allows the user 3 guesses, telling them if they are too high or too low each time.

*discordbot.py* **->** This is a simple Discord bot script. It requires you to have discord.py installed (I recommend using Pip to get it) and currently logs in and sets a status. In future it will have a much wider range of functions and may be migrated out to its own repository.

*sqrt.py* **->** Square root a number or square a number

*insulin_calc.py* **->** Calculate your insulin dose

More stuff coming soon!
