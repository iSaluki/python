# Python Repository
A collection of simple Python scripts

**Note:** If you have any problems with any scripts, please open an issue and I'll be happy to help you. I'm also happy to help out with extending/changing functionality in any of my scripts. Just let me know.

# Reference:

guessgame.py -> This is a simple guessing game which prompts the user to guess a word from a list of preset words in the script.

numbergame.py -> This script prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 after randomly generating one. It then allows the user 3 guesses, telling them if they are too high or too low each time.
